#### Q1

**a: Calculate the Five Number Summary:**
* Min: 150
* Q1: 164
* Median: 167.5
* Q3: 169.5
* Max: 178

**b: Calculate the Sample Mean**
mean = 166

**c: Calculate the Inter quartile Range**
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 5.5

**d: Which, if any, of the observations are possible outliers?**
What is considered an outlier is subjective, though commonly
a point greater than two standard deviations from the mean
are considered as possible outliers. We have a mean of 166 and
a sample s.d. of 9.27, meaning any point outside the range:
166 +- 2* 9.27 = [147.45 184.55] could be considered an outlier.

None of the heights of the six people are possible outliers

**e: Create a boxplot of the observations**
See accompanying Ipython notebook for image (or perhaps it will load here)
![Image](../static/boxplotq1.png?raw=True)

Notice that the box plot considers the 178 cm data point
a potential outlier

**f: Calculate the sample variance and sample s.d.:**
As mentioned in part d, the sample std dev is 9.27.
The sample variance is the square of that, 86.0.
